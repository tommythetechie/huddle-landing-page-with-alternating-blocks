  <h1>Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h1>

  <p></p>Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience. 
  Create connections with your users as you engage in genuine discussion.

  <h2></h2>Grow Together

  <p></p>Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong, loyal community. 
  Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on with a feedback form. 

  <h2></h2>Flowing Conversations

  <p></p>You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online? Our threads 
  have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.

  <h2></h2>Your Users

  <p></p>It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's authentication solution. 
  This means, once signed in to your app, your users can start chatting immediately.
